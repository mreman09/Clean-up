  To create the Covid-19 slideshow that is present on my home page, I used all seven sources that are above. In order to ensure my code worked and did what I wanted it to do, I used the codepen website to trial different HTML, CSS and JavaScript code as it showed me live results of what my code was doing. In addition, to this when I put my code together I took little bits and bobs from all these sources and put it together to create my slideshow. I watched quite a few YouTube videos and tutorials but I mainly used the two videos I have put above.
