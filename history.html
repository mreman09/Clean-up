            <h2>A Brief History of the Virus</h2>
            <h4>Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started.</h4>
            <h4>SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet markets.” They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.</h4>
            <h4>Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among people.</h4>
            <h4>Still, the Wuhan market didn’t sell bats at the time of the outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2.</h4>
            <h4>The novel coronavirus outbreak was first documented in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. As of this writing, it has now been confirmed on six continents and in more than 100 countries. As the world’s health systems funnel resources into learning about, treating, and preventing infections in humans, new information is released daily.</h4>
